				<h1> BANANA AS MEDICINE</h1>
			<p>Banana is a fruit that grows near tropical rainforests. All parts of the plant, including the fruit, leaves, "false stem," stem, flowers, and roots, can be used as medicine. In North America, most of the available bananas are from one specific variety. However, there are many varieties available around the world. Bananas have been grown as crops for thousands of years.
Parts of the banana are used for low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), constipation, and diarrhea. They are also used for diabetes, high cholesterol, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.Possibly Effective for
Diarrhea. In young children, cooked green bananas reduce symptoms and speed up time to recovery from diarrhea due to various causes. In adults fed with a tube, adding banana flakes to liquid feeds reduces symptoms of diarrhea.There is interest in using banana for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.All parts of the banana plant have medicinal applications: the flowers in bronchitis and dysentery and on ulcers; cooked flowers are given to diabetics; the astringent plant sap in cases of hysteria, epilepsy, leprosy, fevers, hemorrhages, acute dysentery and diarrhea, and it is applied on hemorrhoids, insect and other stings and bites; young leaves are placed as poultices on burns and other skin afflictions; the astringent ashes of the unripe peel and of the leaves are taken in dysentery and diarrhea and used for treating malignant ulcers; the roots are administered in digestive disorders, dysentery and other ailments; banana seed mucilage is given in cases of diarrhea in India. Antifungal and antibiotic principles are found in the peel and pulp of fully ripe bananas.</p>
